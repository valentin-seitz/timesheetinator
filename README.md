# Timesheetinator

This little piece of code helps you to automagically fill most of your tables in a time recording system. 

To use it install: https://www.tampermonkey.net in your firefox browser as an addon. 

Then just copy and paste the code in `timesheetinator.user.js` into a new user script, enable it, and enjoy new buttons popping up.
